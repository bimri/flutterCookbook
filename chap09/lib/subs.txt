Subscribing to stream events

In the previous recipes of this chapter, we used the listen method to get values from a
stream. This generates a Subscription. 

Subscriptions contain methods that allow you to
listen to events from streams in a structured way.


In this recipe, we will use Subscription to gracefully handle events, errors, and close the
subscription.
