Using StreamBuilder to create reactive user interfaces

Streambuilder is a widget that listens to events emitted by a stream, and whenever an
event is emitted, it rebuilds its descendants.

StreamBuilder makes it extremely easy to build reactive user interfaces that update every
time new data is available.


In this recipe, we will update the text on the screen with StreamBuilder. This is very
efficient compared to the update that happens with a setState method and its build call,
as only the widgets contained in StreamBuilder are actually redrawn.
