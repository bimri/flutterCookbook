Importing packages and dependencies

The three numbers of the version are denoted as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where breaking
changes happen only in major releases, after version 1.0.0. For versions before 1.0.0,
breaking changes can happen at every minor release.

So, when you write ^0.13.1, this means that any version is equal to or bigger than 0.13.1
and lower than 0.14.0.

When you write ^1.0.0, this means that any version is equal to or bigger than 1.0.0 and
lower than 2.0.0.
