How it works...
An AnimatedContainer is an animated version of a Container widget that changes its
properties over a specific period of time. In this recipe, you have created a transition
animation that changes the color, width, height, and margin of a widget.

When you use an AnimatedContainer the duration is required. Here is the instruction:
    AnimatedContainer(
        duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
This specifies that each time a property of the AnimatedContainer changes, the transition
between the old value and the new one will take 1 second.
